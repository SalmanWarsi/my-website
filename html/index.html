		<h2>Welcome!</h2>
			<p>This page is intended to showcase some of my skills in web and graphic design as well as introduce myself. My name is Salman Warsi and I'm currently attending Valencia College, majoring in web development. I started coding in middle school for a class and it was something I quickly grasped. My teacher really liked me because I was really quick when it came to typing code by hand. <br /> <br /> Fast forward to high school, I didn't code as much but in exchange I learned how to use design programs such as Photoshop and Illustrator. I was taking a class where we had to create various projects ranging from promotional posters to advertise activities on school to turning ourselves into zombies. It was extremely fun and I kept using Photoshop since then. I use the program heavily and everyday I learn new techniques. I consider myself to be pretty good at it. <br /> <br /> Hopefully in the future, as my web development skills increase, I can join a big tech company such as Google or Microsoft and work on websites that millions of people visit daily. Of course I still have a long way to go as I have no idea how to use Javascript or anything else outside of HTML and CSS.</p>
