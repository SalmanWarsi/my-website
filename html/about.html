		<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<img src="../images/self.jpg" alt="My Face" title="This is me!" width="100" height="100" style="border: 1px solid #66d4e7; padding: 3px; float: right;">
			<p>I was born on March 28, 1996 in New Britain, Connecticut. After a year, my family moved down to Kissimmee, Florida and that's where I've lived ever since. I'm Pakistani and I have visited the country twice. The hot and dry climate along with the general dirtiness of the streets made living there unbearable. I currently live in Kissimmee and I'm going to stay here forever, probably. I live 15 minutes away from Valencia's Osceola Campus which is amazing, but I'm going to have to attend East Campus because the classes I need for my degree are all there. <br /> <br /> Personality-wise, I'm a pretty quiet and reserved person. I really don't talk to people outside of my circle of friends. Around my friends, my personality becomes the opposite. I really love hanging out with and talking to my friends; my group is the greatest. <br /><br /> <img src="../images/self2.jpg" alt="My Halloween makeup" title="My Halloween costume!" width="100" height="100" style="border: 1px solid #66d4e7; padding: 3px; float: right;"> Some hobbies of mine are playing video games, browsing the Internet, and watching random shows on Netflix. My favorite TV show is Parks and Recreation, however I depend on Netflix having the series available for streaming because buying the DVD set is crazy expensive. The only video games I play are Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy. I think when they stop making sequels to those games I'll probably stop gaming altogether.</p>
